# Spam Email Detection

This project is a **Spam Email Detection** system that uses a **React** frontend and a **Python** backend. The system classifies incoming emails as **spam** or **not spam** using a **Naive Bayes** machine learning algorithm.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the backend and visualize results.
- **Backend**: Built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses a **Naive Bayes** classifier to determine if an email is spam based on its content.

### Features

- Users can input an email message through the frontend.
- The backend processes the email using a trained Naive Bayes classifier.
- The system returns whether the email is **spam** or **not spam**.
- The application has been deployed and is accessible online.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - Vite
- **Backend**: 
  - Python
  - Naive Bayes Algorithm (via libraries like `scikit-learn` or custom implementation)
- **Deployment**: 
  - Frontend hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) / [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
  - Backend API hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) / [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) / [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for React frontend)
- Python (for backend)
- `pip` (for Python dependencies)
- `npm` or `yarn` (for React frontend dependencies)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-detection.git
cd spam-email-detection
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the backend server (assuming Flask/Django or FastAPI):
   ```bash
   python app.py   # or your backend start command
   ```

   The backend will be accessible at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Connecting Frontend and Backend

Ensure the frontend and backend are configured to communicate. Update the API endpoints in the React app to match your backend's deployment URL (e.g., Heroku or local).

## Deployed Application

You can access the live deployed application here:  
[**Spam Email Detection App**](https://spam-email-detection-react-2.onrender.com/)

## How It Works

1. The user enters an email message in the frontend.
2. The React app sends the email content to the backend via an API call.
3. The backend processes the content using a Naive Bayes classifier.
4. The backend returns the result (spam or not spam).
5. The frontend displays the result to the user.
